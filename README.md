# Craze Token - WebX

The webx selection task for iitkgp/CGS
I've completed making a functional smartcontract in solidity (craze.sol) also have a weird but organized structure for frontend (basically, a div hell).

Well, if you wanna see whatever frontend I'm done with, clone the repo and simply open ./frontend/index.html

Calling functions using ethers is now clear to me. Will update the whole backend setup soon.

- Though I am still getting some gas_estimation issues. Will see about that ...
