# Craze Token - WebX

The webx selection task for iitkgp/CGS
I've completed making a functional smartcontract in solidity (craze.sol) also have a weird but organized structure for frontend (basically, a div hell).

Once, I somehow figure out to connect the backend and frontend, the project CrazeToken v1.0 will be done ;)

Well, if you wanna see whatever frontend I'm done with, clone the repo and simply open ./frontend/index.html
